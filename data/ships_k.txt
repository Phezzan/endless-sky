	description "The ArgoNavis variant of the Southbound Shipyards Argosy was produced to capitalize on the venerable design's popularity. The designer spared no expense to improve the already combat capable freighter.  He succeeded a little too well and the ArgoNavis was classified a warship by the Republic, limiting available market. The company responded by labeling the ship a collector's item."
	description "	The ArgoNavis retains much of the Argosy's customizability, but it was specifically designed to fit atomic engines and heavy lasers."
